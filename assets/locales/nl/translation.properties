# LOCALIZATION NOTE This file is used to generate the
# the 'Translations' screen in the application, which
# gives credit to the translators for their work.
#
# I have initialized the fields with values spelled in English,
# but feel free to change that to the appropriate locale as I cannot spell
# in non western locales.
#
# Language: is the language name for your translation (English,
#  Français, Simplfied Chinese, ...)
#
# Translators: Your name and the name of other people who
#  have contributed to the translation, comma-separated.
#  If you do not want your name to be listed in that page,
#  do not leave the field blank, set it to 'PRIVATE' (all capitals),
#  to prevent Transifex from counting this field as
#  not yet translated.
